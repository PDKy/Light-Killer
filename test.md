## Hi
this is a good start so let's get into it

$$x=1$$

For certain matrix A, we say B is similar to A if there exist a matrix M that
$$B=MAM^{-1}$$
	It is the result of change teh basis

The similar matrix shares the property that
1. they have the same determination
2. their trace is the same

Well the diagonalizable means that if we can find a matrix D (diagonal matrix) that $A=MDM^{-1}$

Diagonal value is the eigenvalue of A
M contains the eigenvector of A. Every column of M is the eigenvector of A


## spectral form
This is for symmetric Matric 
that
$$A=QDQ^T$$

Every column of M is the eigenvector of A
